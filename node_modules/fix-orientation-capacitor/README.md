Rotate images generated by Ionic Capacitor Camera Plugin

** This package is intended for an Ionic Capacitor app only. For correcting orientation of general images, consult fix-orientation **

Ionic Capacitor's Camera Plugin has a correctOrientation attribute that does not work in all Android devices.
This package fixes that issue. This code is based on juliangruber's fix-orientation and works with @capacitor/core": 1.1.1.

## Upgrade

Note that with Capacitor version 1.1.1, resultType is changed from CameraResultType.Base64 to CameraResultType.DataUrl

## Usage

```bash
import { CameraResultType, CameraSource, Plugins } from "@capacitor/core";
import fixOrientation from 'fix-orientation-capacitor';

const { Camera } = Plugins;
// notice the attribute 'correctOrientation' must be set to false
const image = await Camera.getPhoto({
                quality: 60,
                width: 1280,
                allowEditing: false,
                resultType: CameraResultType.DataUrl, // please note with the 1.1.1 upgrade, this is no longer using Base64
                source: CameraSource.Prompt,
                correctOrientation: false });

const fixed = await fixOrientation(image);
```
